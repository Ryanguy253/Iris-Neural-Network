# Iris Classification using PyTorch

This project is a PyTorch implementation of a simple neural network for classifying the Iris dataset into three species. The project follows a tutorial from Codemy.com(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY14KfZQ1TI&list=PLCC34OHNcOtpcgR9LEYSdi9r7XIbpkpK1&index=1)

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features:
1. Sepal length
2. Sepal width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width

Each sample is classified into one of three species of iris flowers:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

In this project, we build a neural network using PyTorch to classify the flowers into their respective species based on these four features.
